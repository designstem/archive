# A Sample Document

Here is a sample of an interactive document. I with the variable below would be, say <variable name="foo" value="50" /> Actually it would be even better when it could be, say <variable name="foo" value="100" />. Or even, should I say, <variable name="foo" value="1000" />. Now this is way better!

<badge name="foo" />
