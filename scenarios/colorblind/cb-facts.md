### <f-fact-icon /> 

~Colour blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately **1 in 12 men** (8%) and **1 in 200 women** in the world.~

-

### <f-fact-icon /> 

~**There are different types of CVD:**~

~1. ***Protanomaly/protanopia***: reduced/missing sensitivity to **red** light~
~2. ***Deuteranomaly/deuteranopia***:  reduced/missing sensitivity to **green** light.~
~3. ***Tritanomaly/tritanopia***: reduced/missing sensitivity to **blue** light.~
~4. ***Achromatopsia***: **complete** colour blindness (everything seen in shades of grey).~

### <f-fact-icon /> 

~**Tritanomaly and achromatopsia are extremely rare** forms of CVD and are both caused by autosomal recessive alleles. People with these forms of CVD inherit two faulty versions (alleles) of genes for normal cone functioning, one from each parent.~

-

### <f-fact-icon />  

~**Protonomaly and deuteranomaly are the more common forms of CVD**, with deuteranomaly being the most common. People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly are collectively known as **red-green colour blind**. They have difficulty distinguishing between reds, greens, browns and oranges. They also commonly confuse different types of blue and purple.~

-

### <f-fact-icon /> 

~Protonomaly and deuteranomaly are both caused by **X-linked recessive alleles** of genes for normal cone functioning. People with protonomaly do have red-sensitive cones but **the photosensitive pigment they contain does not function**. The same goes for deutranomaly and green-sensitive cones.~

-

### <f-fact-icon />

~**Males are much more likely to be red-green colour blind than females** because males have the sex chromosomes XY, so have only one X chromosome. Therefore, to be colour blind they need only one copy of the recessive allele for colour blindness. In contrast, females have the sex chromosomes XX. Therefore, to be colour blind, they would need two copies of the recessive allele, one on each X chromosome.~
